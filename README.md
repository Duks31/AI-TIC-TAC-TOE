# AI-TIC-TAC-TOE

<h3> TIC-TAC-TOE game with AI players </h3>
This is a Python implementation of the popular game of Tic-Tac-Toe with the ability to play against AI players that use different strategies to make their moves. 
The game uses a command line interface to display the board and receive input from the player.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Python 3 (and above)

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Duks31/tictactoe-ai.git
cd tictactoe-ai
```
<h2>Usage</h2>
To play the game against an AI player, run the `game.py` script with Python:

```python
python game.py
```

This will start a game with the AI player using the minimax algorithm and a human player. Follow the instructions on the command line to make your moves.

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
- This project was inspired by the [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg) on building a Tic-Tac-Toe game with Python.
- The game.py file uses code from the player.py file, which was also part of the tutorial.
